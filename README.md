# auto-pdf-organizer
Python-powered automation script to organize downloaded papers and articles in a folder.

Current version:
> Detect downloaded PDF files (from the web browser Download folder)
> Check if the PDF file corresponds to a paper/article (metadata analysis)
> Rename the PDF file if there is a Title field in the metadata
> Move the PDF file to the pre-defined PAPERS folder

Future developments:
> Organize the articles based on Keywords, Authors and so on
> Detect duplicates before handling the files (moving/renaming etc) (!)
